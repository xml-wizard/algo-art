# Algo-art


Embracing code as a medium of design again

### Argument

Most people are going for no code tools to get the job done. This is good and all but it's not good for a programmer when they're starting out. Too much abstraction can cause a lack of indepth understanding of how something works.



### Idea 🤔

This project is targeted at any creative coders, people who who are curious about algorithmic art and color as a topic in software development. The end goal is to build a community mantained knowledge base and a set of  tools to help developers curate custom palettes and gradients as well as create sketches using a common API .




## That's all 😁



###  Interested and would like to collaborate/contribute ? :cool:

That's all for now, I'll update the README as the codebase takes shape 👍🏾
